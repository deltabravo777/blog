Automatic A

I just touched down back to where I live in Seattle from one of my favorite places, Los Angeles. I was with my folks who per usual, enjoy pushing my buttons. So it wasn’t perfect but I do enjoy their company though admittedly it is more difficult when we bicker

At first when I was arriving at LAX to catch our flight I thought to myself “this trip is a solid B” (since I had a good time overall. Even before I got to LA I didn't have specific plans or places I wanted to go to and the people, lodges, and the food was good). But you know, then I thought to myself “fuck it why don’t you just give it an A?”

I wanted to give it an A so I will. But this thought I realize it a part of overall life: when as a kid you do homework you want your teacher to give you an automatic A no matter but as a part of life, you are the evaluator. When I go to a restaurant as a customer I an evaluating, when I finished a vacation, I am evaluating, when I’m in an argument with someone I am evaluating 

There is the paradoxical yet simple matter about our personal life: as the person who is living my life I am performing as to do well, but I’m also the one to enjoy it and evaluate it. So as a part of life, i’m both the student being evaluated and the teacher who is evaluating. For us all, we want to do well and use practical guidelines but sometimes we let ourselves down when we give ourselves the score we didn’t want

When you go about your days and experience life, you can give yourself an automatic A. One’s performance is within one's control, but equally within grasp is the ability to give yourself an evaluation (which is nonetheless done) and make that an A if you just felt like it
